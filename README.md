# Naddy's Extra Controls

More control elements. Simple as.

- `Theme Icon Button`:  I use it in my plugins all the time! Grabs icon from theme by name.
- `Properties Box`: Form to input values like you'd use the inspector. Strings, bools, numbers (*sliders supported*) and enums. Allows foldable groups.
- `Unfolded Option Button`: list of options, pick one or use as bit flags
- `Flipped Split`: anchored to the other side for resizing
- `Data Dropper`: passes drag-and-drop via signal
- `View Switcher`: keeps only one child visible
